Generate a new Drizzle migration for the frontend based on schema changes.

This command will:
1. Generate migration files based on changes in auth-schema.ts
2. Create migration files in the drizzle directory

Execute: `cd nextjs && pnpm drizzle-kit generate`

After generating, review the migration files and then run migrations using the run-migrations command.
